Musings of an Architect
===

You are a Master Builder ([*link*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.codingthearchitecture.com/presentations/softwarecircus2017-return-of-the-architect.pdf))

The software architecture role is about coding, coaching and collaboration ([*link*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.codingthearchitecture.com/presentations/softwarecircus2017-return-of-the-architect.pdf))

The key to success as a software architect is __trust__. Trust with peers, trust with development teams, trust with leaders and trust with clients.

A Software Architect's most useful skills include communication, problem solving and presentation. The job at hand is often articulating a position and influencing outcomes.

The end goal is to ship good, reliable, usable, maintainable software with high quality, low cost and on time. Therefore, the dev teams need to be able to write succinct code, less code, less config. And if the dev team is developing the architecture, the architecture itself needs to be as succinct as possible. Keep it simple.  Succinct : crisp, concise, briefly and clearly expressed. *[Related : Paul Graham - Revenge of the Nerds](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html)*

Don't think mobile-first. It's not just an app or website you're building. It's services. It's data. And you can't necessarily predict the how people will want to interact with it.

Simplify the design. Then simplify again. And when done with that, simplify the design.

In the end, software architecture is about how we distill experience into wisdom, and disseminate it - [Big Ball of Mud, by Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder](http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html)

All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky. ([The Law of Leaky Abstractions - Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/))
