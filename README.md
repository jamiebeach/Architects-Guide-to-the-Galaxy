The software architecture role is about coding, coaching and collaboration ([*link*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.codingthearchitecture.com/presentations/softwarecircus2017-return-of-the-architect.pdf))

The key to success as a software architect is __trust__. Trust with peers, trust with development teams, trust with leaders and trust with clients.

A Software Architect's most useful skills include communication, problem solving and presentation. The job at hand is often articulating a position and influencing outcomes.

The end goal is to ship good, reliable, usable, maintainable software with high quality, low cost and on time. Therefore, the dev teams need to be able to write succinct code, less code, less config. And if the dev team is developing the architecture, the architecture itself needs to be as succinct as possible. Keep it simple.  Succinct : crisp, concise, briefly and clearly expressed.
